# Breast-Cancer-Classification-with-Neural-Network
This repository contains the code and documentation for the "Breast Cancer Classification with Neural Network" project. The primary goal of this project is to develop a robust and accurate deep learning model to classify breast cancer as either malignant or benign using medical imaging data.

# Project Overview
Breast cancer is a leading cause of mortality among women worldwide. Early and accurate detection is crucial for effective treatment and improving patient outcomes. This project leverages the power of neural networks to enhance the diagnostic process, providing a supplementary tool for medical professionals.

# Model Architecture
The neural network architecture designed for this project is a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) with the following components:

Input Layer: Accepts the input features from the dataset.
Hidden Layers: Multiple hidden layers with ReLU activation functions to capture complex patterns in the data.
Output Layer: A single neuron with a sigmoid activation function to classify the tumor as malignant or benign.

# **Training and Optimization**
The model was trained using the backpropagation algorithm, with the following techniques implemented to enhance performance:

Loss Function: Binary cross-entropy loss.
Optimizer: Adam optimizer.
Regularization: Dropout and L2 regularization to prevent overfitting.
Data Augmentation: Techniques to augment the dataset and improve model generalization.

# Conclusion
This project showcases the potential of deep learning in medical diagnostics. By integrating neural networks into the diagnostic process, we can improve the accuracy and efficiency of disease detection and treatment. This repository includes all the necessary code, data preprocessing steps, and model training scripts to replicate the results.
